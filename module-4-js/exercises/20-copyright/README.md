# Exercise #20 - Copyright

Most websites display a copyright disclaimer (commonly in the footer). Some copyright disclaimers show both the copyright holder and copyright year. This can get tedious to update with every new year, but forunately we can automate the task using JavaScript.

You are tasked with writing a function that will select the element containing the copyright year and automatically update its content with the current year.

**Deliverables:**

Write a function named `showCopyrightYear` accepting one parameter:

* `selector` - a selector for the element which will have its content updated.

The function requirements are:

1. The function must not return anything.
2. The `selector` must be able to select an element.
3. The selected element's content must be updated with the current year.
