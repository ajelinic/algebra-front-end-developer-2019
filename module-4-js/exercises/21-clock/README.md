# Exercise #21 - Clock

You are tasked with writing a function that will select an element and display a clock within it.

**Deliverables:**

Write a function named `showClock` accepting one parameter:

* `selector` - a selector for the element which will have its content updated.

The function requirements are:

1. The function must not return anything.
2. The `selector` must be able to select an element.
4. The clock must display the curent hour, minute, and second in the `hour:minute:second` format, e.g. `01:02:03`.
5. The clock must update in real-time with every second.
