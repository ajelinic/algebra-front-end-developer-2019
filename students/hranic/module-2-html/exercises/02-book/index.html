    <h1 lang="en">Markup languages</h1>

    <p lang="en">A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>

    <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>

    <dl>
        <dd><b>Presentational markup</b> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</dd>
        <dd><b>Procedural markup</b> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</dd>
        <dd><b>Descriptive (logical) markup</b> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</dd>
    </dl>

        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>
